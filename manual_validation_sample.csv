"Ecuador and Sweden have agreed to allow Julian Assange to be questioned by Swedish prosecutors inside the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, in a possible breakthrough to a impasse, Ecuador said on Thursday, but no date for the interview was announced. The Ecuadorean attorney general delivered a document agreeing to a request by the Swedish prosecutor to question Mr. Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who is wanted by Sweden for questioning to respond to allegations of rape made against him, accusations he denies. Mr. Assange was granted political asylum by Ecuador in 2012 after his appeal against extradition to Sweden was denied, and he has been confined to the embassy ever since. He says he fears that if he is sent to Sweden, he will then be shipped to the United States, where he could be charged with espionage offenses. WikiLeaks has published damaging and confidential information from the United States and many other governments, and recently, Mr. Assange and the organization attracted attention after the distribution of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and his statements criticizing Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. Although there is no open indictment against Mr. Assange in Washington, he and WikiLeaks are the subject of an investigation in the United States. Mr. Assange has previously offered to be questioned by the Swedish authorities inside the embassy, but prosecutors had insisted until last year that he be interviewed in Sweden. Karin Rosander, a spokeswoman for the Swedish prosecutor's office, said that the investigation was almost finished but that ""the interview with the suspect has been missing all the time. "" Mr. Assange's lawyers in Sweden recently made a new appeal to drop the arrest warrant against him, citing the ""passivity"" of the Swedish prosecutor in trying to question him. He is sought for questioning to see whether he should be charged with ""minor rape"" after an episode in 2010 in Sweden. Earlier allegations of sexual abuse were dropped because of the statute of limitations. A statement issued in Ecuador said, ""In the coming weeks, a date will be established for the proceedings to be held at the embassy of Ecuador in the United Kingdom. "" The statement said that Ecuador and Sweden had signed ""an agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters"" in December, ""which provides the legal framework for the questioning. "" Ms. Rosander said a formal request from Sweden to question Mr. Assange at the embassy, first submitted in January, with a reminder sent in June, asked for the interview to be conducted by a Swedish prosecutor and a police officer. Thomas Olsson, a member of Mr. Assange's legal team, told Radio Sweden that he believed the investigation would be shut down. ""It's hard to imagine that any of the involved parties will have a clear memory of what happened six years ago,"" Mr. Olsson said. ""Another consequence of the delay is that several of the accusations are now barred due to the statute of limitations. We can't see any other outcome for this investigation than that it be shut down. "" In February, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the United Nations ruled that Mr. Assange was being arbitrarily detained and should be released freely and with compensation for the violation of his rights. The opinion was nonbinding and has been rejected by Britain and Sweden. ""Ecuador's Foreign Ministry reiterates its commitment to the asylum granted to Julian Assange in August 2012,"" the statement from Ecuador said, ""and reaffirms that the protection afforded by the Ecuadorean state shall continue while the circumstances persist that led to the granting of asylum, namely fears of political persecution.

"From: Clifford, Tyler (CBC) Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 2:46 PM Subject: PRESS RELEASE: Remarks by CBC Chairman G. K. Butterfield At Press Conference Unveiling New GAO Report on Modern-Day Segregation in Public Schools NEWS RELEASE For Immediate Release May 17, 2016 Remarks by CBC Chairman G. K. Butterfield At Press Conference Unveiling New GAO Report on Modern-Day Segregation in Public Schools WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, CBC Chairman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) gave remarks at a press conference to commemorate the 62nd Anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education and unveil a new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on contemporary racial and socioeconomic segregation and disparities in K-12 public schools. Committee on Education and the Workforce Ranking Member Bobby Scott (VA-03) and Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member John Conyers, Jr. (MI-03), along with retired Congressman George Miller, first requested this report in May 2014 to identify actions needed to reduce segregation and disparities in public schools. The GAO gathered data from the U.S. Department of Education and found that inequities in public schools are the result of race, poverty, and housing segregation patterns. Remarks by CBC Chairman Butterfield, as prepared for delivery, follow: 62 years ago today the Supreme Court took a monumental step to correct the precedent established in Plessy v. Ferguson of ""separate but equal."" The landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision struck Plessy down and held that ""separate was inherently unequal."" At that time, segregation was the law and subjected generations of students of color to inferior education, dilapidated facilities, and significantly reduced resources in order to fulfill a racist and oppressive agenda. After the Brown v. Board decision, it took years of resistance and federal action to integrate schools. But now six decades later, we have seen public schools seemingly regress back to the segregated state we saw during the Jim Crow era. Overt racism has now turned to institutional racism creating structural barriers that have countered the positive impact of the Brown v. Board decision. Racial and socioeconomic segregation in public schools has nearly doubled since 2000 and has occurred primarily in schools where more than 75 percent of the students are Black or Hispanic and eligible for free or reduced lunch. What's more alarming is that three out of five high-poverty schools have high concentrations of students of color. Folks, there is a problem with our education system and we need to take immediate action to restore our promise to provide equal access to educational opportunity. The CBC has been fighting to address not only the racial wealth gap, but also the achievement and opportunity gaps that continue to widen. These gaps pose dire economic consequences for communities of color-we must work to counter these disparities and also to address the school-to-prison pipeline which disproportionately affects African American students. Friends, we have work to do. I want to thank my colleagues Ranking Member John Conyers and Ranking Member Bobby Scott for their leadership in calling for this GAO report. It will require deliberate decisions and efforts to achieve true equity in education and equality for all students in our schools. I call on my colleagues in the House and the Senate to join us in our efforts to create better schools for our youth. # # # Since its establishment in 1971, Members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) have joined together to empower America's neglected citizens and address their legislative concerns. For more than 40 years, the CBC has consistently been the voice for people of color and vulnerable communities in Congress and has been committed to utilizing the full Constitutional power and statutory authority of the United States government to ensure that all U.S. citizens have an opportunity to achieve the American Dream.

"United Airlines barred two teenage girls from boarding a flight on Sunday morning and required a child to change into a dress after a gate agent decided the leggings they were wearing were inappropriate. That set off waves of anger on social media, with users criticizing what they called an intrusive, sexist policy, but the airline maintained its support for the gate agent's decision. The girls, who were about to board a flight to Minneapolis, were turned away at the gate at Denver International Airport, the company said on Sunday. United doubled down on that decision, defending it in a series of tweets on Sunday. The incident was first reported on Twitter by Shannon Watts, a passenger at the airport who was waiting to board a flight to Mexico. In a telephone interview from Mexico on Sunday afternoon, Ms. Watts said she noticed two visibly upset teenage girls leaving the gate next to hers. Both were wearing leggings. Ms. Watts went over to the neighboring gate and saw a ""frantic"" family with two young girls, one of whom was also wearing leggings, engaged in a tense exchange with a gate agent who told them, ""I don't make the rules, I just enforce them. "" Ms. Watts said the girl's mother told her the two teenagers had just been turned away because the gate agent said their pants were not appropriate travel attire. The woman had a dress in her bag that the child was able to pull on over her pants, and the family boarded the flight. ""The girl pulled a dress on,"" Ms. Watts said. ""But please keep in mind that the dad had on shorts that did not hit his knee — they stopped maybe two or three inches above his knee — and there was no issue with that. "" Ms. Watts judged that the two girls who were barred from boarding were in their ""young teens"" and the girl who changed into a dress was 10 or 11. Ms. Watts described the situation in a series of tweets before her flight to Mexico took off. By the time she landed her tweets had been shared widely, often accompanied by sharp criticism directed at the airline. Jonathan Guerin, a spokesman for United, confirmed that two teenage girls were told they could not board a flight from Denver to Minneapolis because their leggings violated the company's dress code policy for ""pass travelers,"" a company benefit that allows United employees and their dependents to travel for free on a standby basis. Mr. Guerin said pass travelers are ""representing"" the company and as such are not allowed to wear Lycra and spandex leggings, tattered or ripped jeans, midriff shirts, or any article of clothing that shows their undergarments. ""It's not that we want our standby travelers to come in wearing a suit and tie or that sort of thing,"" he said. ""We want people to be comfortable when they travel as long as it's neat and in good taste for that environment. "" He said both teenage girls stayed behind in Denver, ""made an adjustment"" to their outfits and waited for the next flight to Minneapolis. Mr. Guerin did not know if they had successfully boarded or not, and also had no information about the girl Ms. Watts said she saw change into a dress at the gate. The company largely confirmed Ms. Watts's account earlier in the day in a response to her on Twitter that did little to mollify the concerns of its critics. In a series of dozens of tweets, the company said the incident was not simply the result of an overzealous gate agent. Instead, it said United Airlines reserved the right to deny service to anyone its employees deemed to be inappropriately dressed. It also referred to the dress code applied to pass travelers. ""In our Contract of Carriage, Rule 21, we do have the right to refuse transport for passengers who are barefoot or not properly clothed,"" the company tweeted. It added, ""There is a dress code for pass travelers as they are representing UA when they fly. "" Few critics appeared to be satisfied by that explanation, which also did little to a perilous public relations situation for the company. United was the target of scores of angry and mocking tweets on Sunday, including from social celebrities like the model Chrissy Teigen and the actor LeVar Burton. By Sunday afternoon, the company's Twitter account was engaged in a tense back and forth with the Academy actress Patricia Arquette, who posted dozens of angry tweets about the situation. Employees running United's Twitter account spent the day walking a public relations tightrope: explaining to angry social media users why the company was not wrong to bar the young women from boarding, while reassuring potential customers that they would not also be barred if they showed up in leggings. People like to be comfortable when they fly, Ms. Watts said, and leggings and yoga pants have become standard casual attire for women. ""I'm pretty sure yoga pants are a thing,"" Ms. Watts said. ""They're part of modern America. They're a staple, a clothing item. "" Mr. Guerin said the company was aware of the criticism leveled at its social media team, but said they were ""working as hard as they can. "" ""We could have stopped to immediately ask the right questions,"" he said. ""We are always engaging with our customers as quickly as possible. Now we are going back. All day we've been going back since that earlier tweet. Now we're going back and telling people what is actually going on. """,0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999970422553657

"Yep Hillary s now a champion of lesbians and gay marriage. Or is she? It s hard to tell exactly what Hillary stands for.

Among them, two lesbians who look lovingly into each other s eyes.However, in her 2008 campaign, Clinton did not support gay marriage.

"The failed North Korean missile test over the weekend was an attempt by the reclusive country to ""provoke something,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday, pledging that the United States will work with China to reduce tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programmes seen by Washington and others as a direct threat. On Saturday North Korea carried out a missile launch which the Pentagon said failed, blowing up almost immediately . Speaking with reporters on his way to the Middle East, Mattis said the most recent test was not an intercontinental ballistic missile but still a reckless move. ""It shows why we are working so closely right now with the Chinese... to try to get this under control and aim for the denuclearized Korean peninsula,"" Mattis said. Trump acknowledged on Sunday that the softer line he had taken on China's management of its currency was linked to its help on North Korea. The United States, its allies and China are working on a range of responses to North Korea's missile test, U.S. officials have said. China itself has spoken out against the North's weapons tests and has supported U.N. sanctions. It banned imports of North Korean coal on Feb. 26, cutting off its most important export and Chinese media has raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to North Korea if it unleashed more provocations. On Monday U.S. Vice President Mike Pence put North Korea on notice, warning that recent U.S. strikes in Syria and Afghanistan showed that the Trump administration's resolve should not be tested. The Trump administration is focusing its strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including an oil embargo, a global ban on its airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang. The North has warned of a nuclear strike against the United States if provoked. It has said it has developed and would launch a missile that can strike the mainland United States but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999943177377454

"President Donald Trump said on Saturday he will move quickly to nominate a new FBI director, after he sparked a political firestorm by firing the man investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. Trump told reporters he might even be able to make his decision on who should succeed James Comey to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation before he leaves on his first foreign trip on Friday. ""Even that is possible,"" Trump said, speaking on Air Force One before departing for Lynchburg, Virginia, where he delivered a commencement address. ""I think the process is going to go quickly,"" he said, adding that the candidates under consideration were mostly well known. ""They've been vetted over their lifetime essentially. But very well known, highly respected, really talented people. And that's what we want for the FBI."" Critics have assailed Trump for abruptly dismissing Comey, who was leading the agency's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.. Russia denies the claims and the White House says there was no collusion. Trump made the remarks to reporters prior to speaking to about 50,000 people at Liberty University in Lynchburg, where he did not mention Comey or the controversy his dismissal on Tuesday caused. It was Trump's first public event outside the White House since Comey's ouster. A White House official had said 11 people were under consideration - including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Republican Senator John Cornyn, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia and former Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher - to replace Comey as FBI chief. Two new names, however, emerged on Saturday: FBI special agent Adam Lee and U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson. A source familiar with the process said Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had interviewed Hudson, Lee and five others on Saturday. The FBI Agents Association, which claims more than 13,000 active and retired agents as its members, on Saturday endorsed another candidate: former Representative Mike Rogers, who had also worked as an FBI agent. At Liberty, the nation's largest Christian college, Trump peppered his remarks with the kind of anti-establishment rhetoric that fueled his maverick presidential campaign, telling graduates to challenge ""entrenched interests."" He thanked the crowd for their support and repeatedly invoked his own unlikely election victory. ""Relish the opportunity to be an outsider,"" Trump said. ""The more that a broken system tells you that you're wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead."" He also had strong words that seemed aimed at his critics. ""No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can't be done,"" Trump said. ""Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they're people that can't get the job done."" Liberty's president, Jerry Falwell, Jr., was a key early supporter of Trump during his campaign and helped rally support among religious conservatives. Trump, who has been preparing for his first foreign trip - one that will take him to the Middle East and Europe - also will deliver the commencement address to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, on Wednesday.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999974963098922

"The United Nations Security Council established a Mali sanctions regime on Tuesday that allows the body to blacklist anyone who violates or obstructs a 2015 peace deal, hinders the delivery of aid, commits human rights abuses or recruits child soldiers. Anyone added to the blacklist would be subjected to a global travel ban or asset freeze, according to the French-drafted resolution, which was unanimously adopted by the 15-member Security Council. We do see the sanctions as an additional tool in order to promote the peace agreement, French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told the Security Council. Time is not on our side and the peace agreement in Mali is one of the keys to stabilization of the regional situation in the Sahel. The vast, arid Sahel region has in recent years become a breeding ground for jihadist groups some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that European countries, particularly France, fear could threaten Europe if left unchecked. A 2015 peace deal signed by Mali s government and separatist groups has failed to stop violence in northern Mali by Islamist militants, who have also staged assaults on high-profile targets in the capital Bamako, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. French forces intervened in 2013 to drive back Islamist fighters who had hijacked the Tuareg uprising to seize Mali s desert north in 2012. The U.N. Security Council then deployed peacekeepers to the country. Attacks on U.N. troops have made it the world body s deadliest peacekeeping mission. Anyone who attacks peacekeepers could be blacklisted by the Security Council.

"Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives forged ahead on Tuesday with legislation to reshape the federal tax code, while a top credit-ratings agency said the bill would balloon the budget deficit and give only a temporary boost to the economy. As the House tax committee weighed amendments to a bill that Democrats have blasted as a give-away to corporations and the rich, the Washington tax reform debate was fast shifting to the Senate, where Republicans hold only a slim majority. Senate Republicans are expected to unveil their own tax bill at the end of the week, and early indications suggest it could differ significantly from the House legislation. The House is aiming to vote on its bill next week, a senior Republican said. Tax reform has been a priority for President Donald Trump, who says it will stimulate economic growth. But Republicans have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. Trump made another pitch for Democratic support on Capitol Hill, where his top aides met with about a dozen Senate Democrats and Trump himself phoned in from his Asia trip. ""He said, 'Look … I want to do it in a bipartisan way,'"" Senator Joe Donnelly told reporters. Fitch Ratings predicted that a Republican tax plan would win passage in both chambers, but did not see it offering long-term benefits. ""Such reform would deliver a modest and temporary spur to growth. ... However, it will lead to wider fiscal deficits and add significantly to U.S. government debt,"" Fitch said, revising up its medium-term U.S. government debt forecast. The U.S. national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. Republicans once firmly opposed adding to the debt, but their emphasis has changed. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) said the House bill would add nearly $1.5 trillion to the national debt from 2018 through 2027. Trump and congressional Republicans say the proposed tax cuts would boost economic growth enough to generate new revenues that would offset the tax cuts. Few economists agree. The House bill slashes tax rates for large corporations, small businesses and wealthy Americans, while sharply reducing or eliminating tax breaks that benefit many middle-class Americans such as deductions for state and local taxes, college tuition and home mortgage interest. JCT estimates that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023. House Republicans, who have an overwhelming majority, drafted their bill in secret, ignoring Democrats. But the House bill is unlikely to be taken up in the Senate, where Republicans have a 52-48 seat majority and they need to pay heed to moderates within their own ranks as well as Democrats, lobbyists and analysts said. Two conservative Republican senators, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have already voiced concern that the House tax bill could raise taxes on some middle-class Americans. The Senate bill could delay the proposed corporate tax cut by one year, may not allow any deductions for local property taxes, and may not collapse the current seven individual brackets to the four proposed by the House, according to the Washington Post. Republican leaders have pushed for the House to vote on the tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. ""My donors are basically saying, get it done or don't ever call me again,"" Republican Representative Chris Collins said. U.S. tax legislation must begin in the House. ""We'll bring it to the floor next week,"" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News. In party-line votes on Tuesday, Brady's tax committee voted down eight Democratic amendments that would have preserved or expanded tax breaks for the middle class, nullified the tax legislation if it increased the deficit in future years and maintained taxes on foreign profits of U.S. corporations. Brady offered a sweeping amendment on Monday that tweaked at least half a dozen provisions of the 425-page bill. One related to carried interest income, a share of an investment fund's profits paid out to the fund's general partners and which represents a large portion of many fund managers' incomes. Carried interest currently is taxed at the capital gains rate, which is substantially lower than the personal income tax rate for higher earners. Brady's amendment would lengthen to more than three years from one the time period assets must be held in order to be eligible for the capital gains tax rate. The amendment would also reduce the amount of carried-interest income eligible for the lower rate.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999976416345175

"Japan's defense minister on Saturday backed the United States using any option to deal with North Korea, including military strikes, and said Tokyo wanted to build a deeper alliance with Washington that could play a regional security role. ""The United States is making clear through both words and deeds that all options are on the table. I strongly support the U.S. position,"" Japanese Minister of Defense Tomomi Inada said during a speech at a regional security conference in Singapore. Pyongyang's accelerating nuclear and missile programs are stoking fear in nearby Japan and prompting a harder line on North Korea from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. A Japanese helicopter carrier and destroyer are concluding three days of drills with two U.S. aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan that also included simulated combat sorties between U.S. Navy F-18s and Japanese air force F-15s. The exercise followed three ballistic missile tests by Pyongyang in as many weeks. The latest on Monday reached an altitude of 120 km (75 miles) before falling into international waters in the Sea of Japan, but inside an exclusive economic zone where Japan has jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of maritime resources. Apart from using the U.S. alliance to tackle its belligerent neighbor, Japan also wants the military partnership to exert influence on other parts of Asia, including the highly contested South China Sea, Inada said. China claims almost all the disputed waters, which is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, and its growing military presence has fueled concern in Japan and the West. ""The robust, long-standing Japan-U.S. alliance now functions as a public good that contributes to the peace and stability of the region,"" she said. Beijing often rails against the United States, Japan and other countries for what it sees as interference in the South China Sea, insisting it is for claimant countries involved in disputes to work them out. Inada also called on European navies to provide ""a regular and visible presence"" in the region. A French amphibious assault carrier visited Japan in April after sailing through the South China Sea. Japan's military later trained with the French force alongside U.S. and British contingents in what sources earlier told Reuters was meant as a show of force aimed at China.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999978798819983

"Dear Eystein and Peck, Many thanks for your relpy and contribution for the glacier box. Everything is fine with me except for the sentence: ""Comparing the ongoing retreat of glaciers with the reconstructed records, it is evident that the current global pattern is unprecedented within the Holocene, as there is no known period with a global homogenous trend of retreating glaciers over centennial and shorter timescales."" The reason of my disagreement is the following: the resolution and the spatial and temporal coverage of the Holocene glacial records is not enough to compare it seriousely at the century level. For most of regions we even cannot estimate the synchroniety of the records. Looking at the figure a reader will see that there was actually a period with ""a global homogenous trend of retreating glaciers"" during at least a millennium (at least 7000-8000 bp) - not a century like now! To resolve this problem we can discuss in a braoder audience and ask the opinion of more experts if you wish - I can think of Luckman, Nesje, Grove, Porter, Karlen. I corrected a little the second paragraph - removed three references - they are not used in our picture and, in fact not that good in terms of real reconstructions. I think we should stress clearly that the records from Scandinavia is now the most reliable and detailed.

"If walls could talk, Chatsworth House, with its sublime Painted Hall, Sculpture Gallery and endless parade of gilded staterooms, would have some tales to tell. Considered one of the great treasure houses of England, set amid the rolling green hills of the Derbyshire Dales, the estate has played host over the last 500 years to some of Britain's most captivating and infamous women, including: Bess of Hardwick Mary, Queen of Scots Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire Kathleen Kennedy, known as Kick (sister to John F. Kennedy) and Deborah Mitford, known as Debo. Their stories, and much more, will be revealed as part of an exhibition, ""House Style: Five Centuries of Fashion at Chatsworth,"" which opens to the public on Saturday. Curated by Hamish Bowles, international editor at large at American Vogue, and with creative direction and design by Patrick Kinmonth and Antonio Monfreda, the exhibition will delve into Chatsworth's rich sartorial heritage, using the lives of its inhabitants and their glamorous guests as mannequins on which to hang stories of the wider history of the house. ""To be let loose in the wardrobe rooms, the gold vaults, the muniment room and the closets, cupboards and attics of Chatsworth — a place I came to as a little boy with a ticket in my hand and wonder in my eyes — has been a truly joyous experience,"" Mr. Bowles said recently in a telephone call from the stately home. Lady Laura Burlington, the of the current Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, conceived of the exhibition while hunting for a christening robe. She found umpteen perfectly preserved options complete with capes, underdresses and bonnets, which led her to wonder what else might lie undiscovered. Six years later, Mr. Bowles has seen his curatorial vision become a reality. The exhibition is organized by theme, including Coronation Dress Bess of Hardwick and the Tudor Influence the Georgiana Effect and Country Living and Entertaining at Chatsworth, though a standout moment for him may be a reimagining of the Devonshire House Ball, situated in the grandest staterooms in the house. Held in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, the ball, with 400 guests dressed as allegorical figures (and, crucially, photographed) was the grandest fancy dress ball of the century. Assistant curators for the exhibition spent months tracking down a handful of the original costumes, bringing them together for the first time since the night of the party. Mr. Bowles gasped as he described a Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, gown made by the couturier Worth for Louise, the formidable wife of the eighth duke, and arguably the jewel in the display's crown. ""So often,"" Mr. Bowles said, ""clothing is the most vivid entry point into getting a sense of how people of the past lived and existed in an environment or even a single moment in time. To create this exhibit on the landscape of Chatsworth, where so many legendary lives and moments have unfolded, has just been extraordinary. "" Lady Burlington, a former model and fashion buyer, said that her first meeting with Mr. Bowles was less than auspicious. ""We met many years ago on an fashion shoot for Harper's and Queen,"" Lady Burlington said, ""where Hamish was the stylist, I was the model, and thanks to an overly snug Vivienne Westwood corset, I promptly fainted. "" Mr. Bowles helped revive her, she added, by giving her a cup of tea and a biscuit. Luckily, their next meeting proved more fruitful. Beyond the historical gems they unearthed, the exhibition is notable for its wealth of contemporary contributions, with garments from modern fashion labels like Alexander McQueen, Erdem, Maison Margiela, Vetements, Vivienne Westwood and Gucci, the exhibition's principal sponsor. Last year, Gucci shot its 2017 cruise collection at Chatsworth, and the house clearly made its mark on the creative director Alessandro Michele, who said it was ""unlike anywhere else in the world, full of charm and rituals. "" ""You can see history everywhere,"" Mr. Michele said, ""yet everything is alive. "" The most recent Gucci runway collection was packed with what Lady Burlington termed ""Chatsworth detail,"" including fabrics, colors and bejeweled bugs and bees crawling over suiting and shirts. Given the calligraphy offerings on the Milan runway last month, Mr. Michele may also have been taken with the 11th duke's trove of novelty slogan pullovers, printed with phrases like ""Get Up and Do Something,"" ""Far Better Not"" ""All Passion Spent"" and ""Never Marry a Mitford. "" The duke's wife, Debo Mitford (one of six Mitford sisters who dominated British high society in the 1930s) died in 2014, but she is represented in the exhibition. An ice pink satin ""Carmel"" gown she commissioned from Dior from its spring 1953 collection is a centerpiece of the show, while other highlights include her collection of bug and butterfly brooches and a pair of her favorite slippers, emblazoned with the image of Elvis Presley. Lady Burlington added wistfully that there might have been even more from the dowager duchess in the exhibition had she not willingly given away so many treasures. ""Debo kept some things for sentimental reasons but generally thought nothing of passing clothes on,"" she said. ""As a result, her garments could turn up in the most unlikely of places. "" Lady Burlington recounted a story told by Charlotte Mosley about a time when the author had attended the local nativity performance alongside the duchess. The two had been sitting there for some time before the dowager suddenly sat upright in her chair, her eyes lit up. ""Oh my goodness, I can't believe it,"" Lady Burlington said, repeating the account of the duchess' reaction. ""The Angel Gabriel is in my Givenchy!""",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999955665934277

President Barack Obama has doubled the size of government since he took office.,1,political_statements,en,en,0.9999970448084617
"At the Democratic National Convention this summer, Hillary Clinton said were due for a tax increase. ""This is not because we resent success,"" she said. ""But when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is. "" But defining America's 1 percent — and finding out ""where the money is"" — has become an increasingly subjective endeavor. As wealth becomes more concentrated in certain states and even counties, the gap between the national 1 percent and the local 1 percent is growing, creating wealth clusters that are pulling away from the rest of the country. To be in the top 1 percent of incomes nationally, families need to take in a minimum of $389, 436. The average income of America's is $1, 153, 293, according to a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute. Yet when incomes are measured state by state, the study shows wildly diverging fortunes for . in the New York metro area (which includes parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania) earn at least $673, 000. Those in the Conn. area make at least $1. 4 million. Both are eclipsed by the of Jackson, Wyo. who earn at least $1. 7 million. Why Jackson? Billionaires have been flocking to Wyoming, attracted by its outdoor lifestyle and low taxes. Teton County, Wyo. is the richest in America when it comes to 1 percent incomes, with earning more than $2. 2 million. New York County, or Manhattan, ranks second, with a $1. 44 million threshold, followed by Fairfield County, Conn. with just under $1. 4 million. The tech boom has helped the 1 percent in San Mateo County and Marin County, Calif. where they earn at least $1. 1 million. By contrast, you need only $97, 000 to be a in Holmes County, Miss. or Lamar County, Ala. or $108, 000 in Grayson County, Va. ""All high incomes are going up, but they're going up much faster in places like New York, Maryland and California,"" said Mark Price, a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center and of the Economic Policy Institute study. It's no surprise that the most expensive states have the highest incomes at the top. And wealth, by nature, has always been relative. Yet economists and wealth experts say the economic distance between in rich states and the in middling or even affluent states has widened drastically, creating a new national landscape of the 1 percent. ""We have a growing concentration of wealth and income by locality,"" said Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University. ""The localities and those top earners are moving away from the rest of the country. "" Regionally, the Northeast has been pulling away the fastest. The income threshold of the top 1 percent surged 101 percent in the Northeast from 1979 to 2013, according to Mr. Price. In the South and Midwest, the threshold has grown by about half that. In Massachusetts, ' incomes jumped 130 percent from 1979 to 2013 they've increased by 112 percent in New York and 113 percent in New Jersey. In New Mexico, they've grown only 22 percent over the same period, and in Nevada, only 15 percent. Yet the rich are also moving beyond the traditional hubs of the Northeast and California, creating some unlikely enclaves, such as Wyoming. North Dakota also moved up the ranks — from 45th to ninth from 1979 to 2013 — as the oil boom lifted the fortunes of its fortunate. The new peaks and valleys of America's elite have made national definitions less and less useful. The 1 percent is no longer the very top layer of the national economy, but a much deeper slice of residents in states like New York, Connecticut and California. The shift has important policy and cultural implications. Calls to tax the 1 percent nationally are really calls to tax the top 5 or 10 percent in the richest states — while missing the top 1 percent in many Western and Southern states. ""A tax on the 1 percent is increasingly a regional tax,"" Mr. Price said. ""On average, more folks will be touched by higher rates in New York than, say, West Virginia. "" Many economists say that's as it should be — people making more than $389, 000 should pay higher tax rates, regardless of where they live. ""They should pay more,"" Mr. Wolff of N. Y. U. said. ""It shouldn't matter where they live. They're earning large amounts of money. "" Yet they may not feel like top earners. People making $389, 000 in New York or Connecticut, for instance, are only in the top 10 percent for their states. They may not feel like since so many people around them are far richer. ""I have friends who may be in the 1 percent nationally but say they don't feel rich because they have friends who are richer,"" Mr. Wolff said. ""Psychologically they don't feel like a . They don't feel rich. But they really are. """,0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999974149252424

"The hypocrisy of our media is astounding! What about Hillary s major corporate donors like GE for example, that have been working the loopholes in our tax system for decades? Does anyone care that Hillary has been taking money from some of America s biggest corporate tax dodgers for several years? Bernie Sanders recently outed the 10 biggest multinational corporations that paid no federal taxes for at least one year between 2008 and 2012. Sanders has made reining in corporate tax dodgers a key point of his presidential platform. In a recent press release, the Sanders campaign laid out the Vermont senator s plans to force multinational corporations to pay their fair share in taxes:As it turns out, all ten of those same companies are some of Hillary Clinton s biggest donors, whether to her campaign or to her family foundation.1. GENERAL ELECTRIC According to data from the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), GE posted $33.9 billion in U.S. profits, yet somehow got $2.9 billion in refunds in that same time period. According to the book Clinton Cash, then-Secretary of State Clinton lobbied the Algerian government for a GE power plant contract. After Algeria awarded the contract to GE, Jeffrey Immelt CEO of GE gave a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Sanders also pointed out that while Immelt sat on the board of the New York Federal Reserve, the Fed gave GE $16 billion in financial assistance.2. BOEING Boeing is one of the nation s biggest corporate tax dodgers, making over $20 billion in profits between 2008 and 2012 and paying an overall income tax rate of negative one percent during those years. Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer noted that after Secretary Clinton successfully lobbied the Russian government to enter into a $3.7 billion contract to buy Boeing s aircraft, the aerospace company gave the Clinton Foundation a hefty donation of $900,000.3. VERIZON In the four years between 2008 and 2012, Verizon pocketed over $30 billion in profits and paid a tax rate of -1.8 percent, according to CTJ. The Sanders campaign s research claims that in 2012 alone, Verizon would have paid $630 million in income taxes had they been unable to stash U.S. profits in offshore tax havens.Verizon has given between $118,000 and $300,000 to the Clinton Foundation in recent years. And as Zaid Jilani reported in Alternet last year, Hillary Clinton is the favored candidate of numerous Verizon executives, many of whom have given the maximum donation to her 2016 effort:Verizon vice-presidents Lydia Pulley, Kathleen Grillo, and Donna Epps each gave $2,700 to Hillary for America. Verizon senior vice-president Thomas Edwards and vice-president Chris Debosier pitched in $1,000. Leecia Eve, a former Hillary staffer who today is a lobbyist for Verizon gave $2,700. Another Verizon lobbyist, David Lamendola, gave Hillary $1,000.To contrast, Sanders appeared at a rally for striking Verizon workers in New York City last year, demanding the company meet the workers demands and admonishing its executives for the company s greedy practices.4. BANK OF AMERICA In 2010, Bank of America got a whopping $1.9 billion refund from the IRS despite making $4.4 billion in profit. And the Institute for Policy Studies reported that Bank of America has over 300 foreign subsidiaries in countries and territories universally known as tax havens, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.In his recent groundbreaking report for The Intercept, Jilani reported that Bank of America paid Hillary Clinton $225,000 in speaking fees after her tenure as Secretary of State.5. CITIGROUP Citigroup was the largest recipient of federal bailout money, getting an astonishing $2.5 trillion after the financial crisis even though they played a major role in the financial meltdown. Citi also paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2010 despite making profits in excess of $4 billion. Had the bank been unable to utilize offshore tax havens, it would have paid $11.5 billion in federal taxes in 2012.According to campaign finance database OpenSecrets.org, Citigroup is Hillary Clinton s top donor, having given over $824,000 in campaign contributions throughout her political career.6. PFIZER The Connecticut-based pharmaceutical giant is notorious for its tax avoidance strategies, paying $0 in federal income tax between 2010 and 2012 and getting a $2.2 billion tax refund despite posting $43 billion in global profits.Pfizer executives gave nearly $40,000 to Clinton s presidential campaign between April and September 2015. And Pfizer itself has given between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to donor records obtained by the Washington Times.7. FEDEX In 2011, FedEx made $2.7 billion in profit, yet they were given a $135 million tax refund from the IRS that same year. FedEx also receives $1 billion a year in corporate welfare from the U.S. Post Office its chief competitor to use its aircraft to transport U.S. mail.FedEx has given anywhere between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. The company was also one of four corporations to bundle a $2.5 million donation to Clinton s new diplomacy center (Boeing was another).8. HONEYWELL Despite making over $3 billion in combined profits between 2009 and 2010, Honeywell paid $0 in federal income taxes and got roughly $510 million in refunds. Honeywell CEO David Cote was also one of the loudest voices on the Fix The Debt campaign, calling for the Social Security and Medicare age to be raised to 70.Honeywell, a prominent weapons manufacturer, also gave $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. At the same time, Honeywell and others had their weapons shipped to countries blasted by international watchdogs for their deplorable records on human rights.9. MERCK Merck is one of the nation s largest pharmaceutical companies and biggest tax dodgers in 2009, Merck pocketed $5.7 billion in profits, yet paid $0 in federal taxes. Merck successfully got out of paying $18.69 billion in federal taxes in 2012 by stashing $53.4 billion of its U.S. profits in overseas tax havens.The Center for Responsive Politics reports that Merck donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation after becoming a member of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2006. It also spent millions on lobbying the U.S. State Department during Hillary Clinton s tenure as Secretary of State.10. CORNING CTJ reports that between 2008 and 2012, Corning made over $3.4 billion in profits and got a $10 million tax refund, paying a 0.1 percent federal tax rate. The Sanders campaign pointed out that Corning CEO Wendell Weeks has called for the retirement age to be raised to 70, while he himself has a $22.8 million retirement account.While Clinton headed up the State Department, Corning lobbied heavily for multiple policies on which it stood to reap financial gains, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton, in turn, lobbied China to lower tariffs on the type of goods manufactured by Corning. The company has also donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation and paid the former Secretary of State $225,000 in speaking fees after she announced her presidential campaign.",1,fake_news,en,en,0.9999947465601207

"The White House tried very hard Friday to send a clear message that the success of President Donald Trump's tax and infrastructure agenda does not turn on the fate of the Obamacare replacement bill. [House Speaker Paul Ryan, only minutes after pulling his health care bill, appeared to at least partially contradict that. ""Yes. This does make tax reform more difficult,"" Ryan said. ""But it does not in any way make it impossible. "" Even though Ryan went on to say the House would ""proceed with tax reform,"" he appeared to be far less optimistic than the two top Trump administration economic officials who spoke earlier on Friday. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both had essentially the same message Friday morning: plans for tax reform, job creation, trade deals, and infrastructure spending remain intact regardless of what happen to the health care bill. Standing on the White House lawn Friday morning, Mulvaney told CNBC that President Trump decided to stop negotiating with lawmakers over the healthcare bill because he ""has other things he wants to do. "" ""He wants to get tax reform done. He wants an infrastructure bill approved. He's got other jobs programs moving through the White House,"" Mulvaney said. Mulvaney went on to say that the White House does not believe tax reform will turn ""one way or the other"" based on the fate of the Obamacare replacement bill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Friday morning said passing a overhaul would be easier than replacing Obamacare. ""In a way, it's a lot simpler,"" Mnuchin said at an event sponsored by Axios. ""In health care, it's a much, much more complicated issue. "" The administration is close to completing its tax reform proposal, according to Mnuchin. He said that the proposal would be aimed at delivering a tax cut for the middle class and would include reforms to both personal and corporate taxes. The administration would push to get Congress to pass a tax bill before the August recess, Mnuchin said. Many in the business community and on Wall Street have recently voiced concerns that tax reform might be stalled until 2018 or even later. Mnuchin also spoke about the administration's infrastructure spending plan, saying that he expected most of the $1 trillion to be financed primarily by private capital backed by and partnerships.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999956381477244
"A tidal wave is coming. Michael Moore, a liberal's liberal who holds die-hard loyalty to Hillary Clinton, is acknowledging what everyone with a clear head recognizes: that she doesn't even remotely connect with the average voter, doesn't understand their problems – and above all, doesn't care about them. Although Moore can't support Donald Trump, he seems to admire his ability to resonate with the actual problems that the people who formerly made up the middle class are going through – economic and otherwise. Moore, like Trump, understands the pulse of the people, though they differ in just about every other way. This election represents a pivotal point, and an end of the line for the deal that people once held with their leaders. After decades of broken promises and deals to sell them short and sell them out, people have had enough. THAT'S what this election is about. Right or wrong, Trump represents a rebuke of the system – as Moore calls it, the ultimate ""F––– You"" ever directed at the system. If you make this go viral, Trump will win. It's 4 minutes that makes the choice in this election crystal clear. #EarlyVoting pic.twitter.com/UOgqSfet6a  — Jared Wyand (@JaredWyand) October 25, 2016  Here's some of what he said in an epic rant (reportedly excerpted from his rush-election film Trumpland) that is strangely validating of Trump's entire campaign: Whether Trump means it or not, it's kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things that people who are hurting. And it's why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle-class loves Trump.  ""They're not racists or rednecks, they're actually pretty decent people. So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this."" […] Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody's going to buy them.  It was an amazing thing to see. No politician — Republican or Democrat — had ever said anything like that to these executives. It was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about. He is the human Molotov cocktail that they have been waiting for. The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th — Election Day — although they have lost their jobs. Although they've been foreclosed on by the bank. Next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone. The car's been repossessed. They haven't had a real vacation in years. They're stuck with the shitty Obamacare bronze plan. They can't even get a f**king percocet. They have essentially lost everything they had…except one thing. The one thing that doesn't cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution: the right to vote. […] So, on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, take that lever — or felt pen or touchscreen — and put a big f**king X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump.  […] They see that the elites who have ruined their lives hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The Media hates Trump… The enemy of my enemy is who I am voting for on November 8th. Trump's election is going to be the biggest F**K YOU ever recorded in human history.  And it will feel good. What red-blooded American, working stiff or laid off schmo wouldn't want to stick it to the establishment and rebuke the very system that brought them to this point? After all, it is their fault. People have been hurting and in decline for eight long years – and for all his smiles and posturing, Obama hasn't done a damned thing. And Hillary can't even pretend. The people who will be deciding the popular vote in this election want to take down that system and put someone in who will – once and for all – stand up for them. Basically, Americans want revenge. What the electoral college decides is another matter altogether, of course.",1,fake_news,en,en,0.9999974270325223

"Former FBI Director James Comey is now leaking details of a private dinner with President Donald Trump to the media, through some of his close associates. [According to the New York Times, the FBI director had dinner with Trump in January after the inauguration, citing private details of the meeting that portray Comey as a martyr. Comey's people, ""who have heard his account of the dinner"" and spoke anonymously, insist that Trump asked the director to pledge his personal loyalty to him, but he declined. They added that Comey was wary about dining with the president, but believed he couldn't turn him down. The White House, however, disputed the report. ""We don't believe this to be an accurate account,"" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary. ""The integrity of our law enforcement agencies and their leadership is of the utmost importance to President Trump. He would never even suggest the expectation of personal loyalty, only loyalty to our country and its great people. "" According to the White House, one of the many reasons Comey was fired was because he failed to stop sensitive leaks of information to the media. In an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, Trump said he asked Comey whether he was under investigation during a dinner with the FBI director and also spoke with him on the phone. ""I said, if it's possible would you let me know, am I under investigation? He said, 'You are not under investigation. '"" Trump told Holt. Trump said Comey was ""a showboat"" and ""a grandstander. "" ""You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that,"" he said. ""You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn't recovered from that. "" Trump said that he was anxious for the results of the FBI investigation into Russia's efforts to disrupt the election. ""If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it and I want to make sure it will never ever happen,"" he said.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999967877032234
"Donald Trump addressed Great Faith Ministries International, a predominately black church, in Detroit on Saturday. He delivered a focused message on unity and the importance of faith in healing a divided nation. The Republican nominee was greeted warmly by congregants. Although he is not wildly popular among their voting bloc, his message resonated with the faith community. ""For centuries, the African American church has been the conscience of our country,"" Trump told the congregation. ""I will always support your church — always — and defend your right to worship,"" he added. ""I hope my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought."" Trump sympathized with the group, telling them that he wants a country that ensures a right for everyone to a great education and to live in safety and peace. ""I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and there are many wrongs that should be made right,"" he said. Trump's visit comes shortly after hiring former Apprentice star Omarosa Manigault as the director of African-American outreach with the hopes of securing the minority vote. Trump was also joined by former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson. ""Today, I just want to let you know I am here to listen to you and I am doing that,"" Trump said, adding that as a leader he wants to ""step into the community and learn what is going on."" The billionaire mogul did just that as he swayed quietly while the church choir sang ""What a Mighty God We Serve."" Later he was donned with a prayer shawl by the church's pastor, Bishop Wayne Jackson, and given a Jewish Heritage Study Bible. ""This is a prayer shawl straight from Israel. Whenever you're flying from coast to coast -- I know you just came back from Mexico and you'll be flying from city to city -- there is an anointing. And anointing is the power of God,"" Jackson said. ""It's going to be sometimes in your life that you're going to feel forsaken, you're going to feel down, but the anointing is going to lift you up. I prayed over this personally and I fasted over it, and I wanted to just put this on you."" Trump closed his speech by reading 1 John 4:12, 'No one has ever seen God but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.' And that's so true,"" he said. Some of the congregants walked away loving Trump and others said they felt no differently about him. Booker Sawyer III, a real estate agent, told ABC News he was pleased with what he saw. ""It's a blessing to have him here because we just want to hear -- be open to what he has to say,"" he said. Carol Thomas told the news organization that she has been offended by the things he has said in the past, but that his visit was a ""smart move."" ""At least he can have somebody he can talk to, somebody that is on his level as far as economically, that he can see that all a black people are not so impoverished or we need so much help, because some people have arrived and helped themselves,"" she said. Jacqueline Wilson, a cashier and a church member, was reluctant to give her political opinion but referred to the Bible when speaking on Trump. ""God says judge no man because you shall be judged,"" she said. ""It's not about Democrat or Republican, it's about who has God's potential.""",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999980948604367

"The F. B. I. interviewed Hillary Clinton on Saturday morning for its investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by corresponding through a private email server set up for her use as secretary of state, a controversy that has dogged her presidential campaign and provided fodder for her political rivals. The voluntary interview, which took place over three and a half hours at the F. B. I. headquarters in Washington, largely focused on the Justice Department's central question: Did the actions of Mrs. Clinton or her staff rise to the level of criminal mishandling of classified information? It could take weeks or longer to reach a decision, but news that Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, had been questioned in the J. Edgar Hoover Building three weeks before her party's convention quickly reverberated. The Republican National Committee called the step ""unprecedented,"" while Mrs. Clinton's expected opponent in the race for the White House, Donald J. Trump, wasted little time before weighing in. ""It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday. ""What she did was wrong!"" The interview had been weeks in the making as law enforcement officials and Mrs. Clinton's team coordinated schedules. Democrats also hoped that holding the interview on a holiday weekend might ease the anticipated storm. In a telephone interview with Chuck Todd on MSNBC after her meeting, Mrs. Clinton said, ""I've been eager to do it, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion. "" Accompanying Mrs. Clinton into the meeting were her lawyer David E. Kendall Cheryl D. Mills and Heather Samuelson, longtime aides who are also lawyers and two lawyers from Mr. Kendall's firm, Williams Connolly, Katherine Turner and Amy Saharia. Eight officials from the F. B. I. and the Department of Justice conducted the interview, according to a person who was familiar with the substance of the session but declined to be named because the meeting was private. This person characterized the meeting as ""civil"" and ""businesslike. "" Neither the campaign nor the F. B. I. would elaborate. Although the interview on Saturday was an important step toward closure on the email issue, technical analysis of the material remains to be done and could stretch on for an indeterminate period. The F. B. I. regularly interviews key figures before concluding an investigation, and such meetings are not an indication that it thinks the person broke the law. While defense lawyers often advise clients against such interviews, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has been eager for her to cooperate, lest she give her opponents additional ammunition. On Saturday, in a statement after the meeting, the Republican National Committee said that Mrs. Clinton ""has just taken the unprecedented step of becoming the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the F. B. I. as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct. "" Mrs. Clinton has struggled to get beyond the issue, which came to light last year during a congressional investigation into the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. More than 30, 000 emails have since been made public. After spending much of last summer arguing she did not need to apologize for keeping a private server in her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. because the practice was allowed, Mrs. Clinton now frequently apologizes for the practice, saying it had been a mistake. The campaign has prioritized assisting the F. B. I. but it declined to cooperate with a State Department inspector general's audit of Mrs. Clinton's email practices. Those findings, delivered to members of Congress in May, undermined some of Mrs. Clinton's initial statements defending her use of the server. The report said there was ""no evidence"" that she had requested or received approval for the server, despite having ""an obligation to discuss using her personal email account to conduct official business. "" Federal law deems it a crime to ""knowingly"" mishandle classified information outside secure government channels or to permit the practice through ""gross negligence. "" None of the emails on Mrs. Clinton's private server were marked classified at the time they were sent or received, but the Central Intelligence Agency later determined that some contained material that would be considered ""top secret. "" Asked Saturday on MSNBC if she had broken the law, Mrs. Clinton repeated her defense: ""I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified. "" There has been no indication that sensitive information was compromised by Mrs. Clinton's use of a private server. But it has fed a perception that she was trying to hide information, chipping away at data gauging her trustworthiness. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday found that voters deemed Mr. Trump more honest and trustworthy than Mrs. Clinton, 45 percent to 37 percent. ""I have said that I'm going to continue to put forth my record, what I have stood for, do everything I can to earn the trust of the voters of our country,"" she told MSNBC when asked about being seen as less trustworthy than Mr. Trump. ""I know that's something that I'm going to keep working on, and I think that's, you know, a clear priority for me. "" Mrs. Clinton had no public events scheduled on Saturday, but after her F. B. I. interview she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, went to New York and saw the Broadway show ""Hamilton. "" Mrs. Clinton's meeting with the F. B. I. came amid controversy over a brief, unplanned meeting between Mr. Clinton and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch while both were at the Phoenix airport at the same time last week. To avoid any appearance of political meddling, Ms. Lynch said on Friday that she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the F. B. I. director on whether to bring charges in the matter. She said she had made that decision several months ago, before the criticism surrounding her meeting with Mr. Clinton. She described the meeting with Mr. Clinton as a casual conversation that did not touch on the investigation. But it added to Clinton campaign staff members' headaches over the email inquiry, which they had hoped to put behind them before the Democratic convention this month. ""I certainly wouldn't do it again,"" Ms. Lynch said of the meeting with the .",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999951099211087

"Videos Police Departments Refuse Participation In Dakota Access Pipeline Crackdown In addition to the general retreat of departments, two officers have already turned in their badges in support of the protesters. Members of the Stutsman County SWAT watch protesters demonstrating against the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Stand Rock Sioux Reservation, as they stand next to a police barricade on Highway 1806 in Cannon Ball, N.D., Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016.  Standing Rock, North Dakota — Widespread outrage over both the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and violent police crackdowns rages on. That outrage is spreading even to police agencies now returning from deployment to the reservation. Two departments have already refused to return, citing personal and public objections. As if that wasn't enough, an army of sympathizers is re-purposing social media to combat police efforts in Standing Rock.  Minnesota's Hennepin County Sheriff's Department is among that group. Lawmakers, according to MPR News , found police activities in Standing Rock ""inappropriate"". It's to the point where they're considering rewriting legislation to avoid future deployments to incidents like the pipeline resistance.  Police officials, of course, declined to comment on their return from North Dakota or their feelings on what's happening there. It's also made the task of rebuilding trust with the community an even loftier uphill battle. ""I do not support Sheriff Stanek's decision to send his deputies to North Dakota"", says LT. Governor Tina Smith, ""nor did we approve his decision to begin with. I do not have any control over the Sheriff's actions, which I think were wrong, and I believe he should bring his deputies home if he hasn't already.""  Smith's comments split the state's government, however, and she was targeted. Minnesota State Rep. Tony Cornish condemned Smith for prioritizing ""the rights of protesters over the needs of law enforcement"", saying she should apologize to the cops.  Sheriffs from Wisconsin's Dane County were more empathetic, pulling out and refusing to return. According to the Bismarck Tribune , Sheriff Dave Mahoney made the decision after a ""wide cross-section of the community"" decried the deployment. ""All share the opinion that our deputies should not be involved in this situation"", says Mahoney. Dane County's deputies were deployed to Standing Rock for around a week. Sources report Dane County wasn't involved in recent arrests, a string of which scooped up an alderwoman from Madison Wisconsin.  Ald. Rebecca Kemble traveled to North Dakota as a ""legal observer"", filming and participating in prayer ceremonies. When Morton County officers–if they cans till be called that–grabbed and arrested her for engaging in a riot. According to Kemble, no riot was happening. Other Wisconsin departments have been recalled, with at least one staying behind for a more couple weeks.  Many other citizens have been charged for trespassing and participating in non-existent riots, including journalists. One of the most renowned reporters who's faced DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline)- related charges was Amy Goodman of Democracy Now . Goodman's team filmed dog attacks by DAPL contractors who lacked proper K9 licenses. The contractors have also been accused of unethical surveillance, intimidation, and sabotaging the movement by attempting to make authorities believe the protesters have finally turned violent.  Other journalists, including documentarian Deia Schlosberg, face decades in prison for filming climate activists at a separate oil project. Journalists from the independent outlet Unicorn Riot, who recently reported use of a sound cannon on water protectors, have also been arrested.  Thousands of opponents to the pipeline have flooded Standing Rock to repel construction and police brutality. More still have taken to the internet, spreading information in the form of writing, video, photography, and art. Among the renegade tactics is using Facebook to ""check-in"" at Standing Rock. According the Guardian , over a million people–even people I know–have joined the action.  It began with a Facebook post, disclosing that Morton County sheriffs are allegedly using Facebook check-ins to track protesters. ""Checking in""–whether you're at a friend's, restaurant, or escalating resistance–pinpoints your location to a tee. Once you check in, a notification is sent out to, yes, your friends, but theoretically anyone who's capable of watching. It's yet another tool in the bag of tricks authorities have deployed against civilians, and are likely utilizing in Standing Rock.  Some detractors have dismissed the social media action as a waste of time. An editor at The Fifth Column challenged these in a Facebook post, narrating a debate on the subject he'd had. Editor Justin King pointed out that even if the check-in's wasted two minutes of time, multiplied by hundreds of thousands, that equates to two months of wasted police work. Now imagine how ineffective the surveillance may be with millions continuously checking.  Morton County Sheriff's, Guardian reports, called claims of police surveillance misguided ""rumors"". Morton County, by their own account, isn't ""monitoring Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location for that matter."" Before you trust them, consider that Facebook access for water protectors was reported as ""blocked' during a military-style raid on a camp.  Data Collection Nationwide  Other police departments are similarly sketchy when pressured to speak on their surveillance technologies. Wisconsin's Milwaukee PD hid the use of cell site simulators , or Stingrays, from courts for months. Stingrays mimic cellphone towers, thus tricking phones into providing all manner of user information and data  Nearby, the Wauwatosa Police Department , despite having admitting to ""collecting and analyzing cell phone data"" in its public reports, denied ever even coming close to a Stingray. It took the department 5 weeks to respond to that open records request, which is considered unusually long. It remains unknown how Wauwatosa PD, which has been blasted for lack of transparency before , collects cell phone data.  The Hand's Fingers In Open Rebellion  In addition to the general retreat of departments, two officers have already turned in their badges in support of the protesters. North Dakota water protector Redhawk, MintPress reports , disclosed the revelation. The individual also pointed out ""you can see it in some of them, that they do not support the police actions."" ""Some are waking up"", they continued, ""we must keep reminding them that they are welcome to put down their weapons and badge and take a stand against the pipeline as well."" Hints of shame could be seen in the faces of officers who confronted protesters as they blocked them from prayer grounds. As the protesters condemned officers , some of whom looked down or off to the horizon in shame.  The modern era of internet and technology gifts us with a plethora of ways to express ourselves, and help one another. Standing Rock is quickly becoming a stand out of that fact. Citizens, journalists, and activists are all using the internet to achieve their own goals. Whether that be spreading information being blocked, tracking police movements, sending food and rations or just voicing opinions. Standing Rock's resistance is spreading globally, with protests occurring in Europe and elsewhere. As long as construction doesn't stop, the movement won't rest.",1,fake_news,en,en,0.9999970470988192

"Senior U.S. Republicans distanced themselves on Sunday from Donald Trump's comments about a Mexican-American judge, saying they were worried that the tone of his presidential campaign could enrage Latinos, who are a growing U.S. voting bloc. Trump has accused U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of harboring a bias against him in lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University, the New York business man's now-defunct real estate school. The presumptive Republican nominee has suggested Curiel's Mexican-American heritage had influenced the judge's opinion because of Trump's campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he ""couldn't disagree more"" with Trump's comments about the judge. ""I am concerned about the Hispanic vote, America is changing,"" McConnell told ""Meet The Press"". ""I think it's a big mistake for our party to write off Latino Americans. I am concerned about that and I hope he will change his direction on that."" Democrats have accused Trump of racially tinged rhetoric about Latinos, including his description of Mexican immigrants as ""criminals and rapists"" in the speech he gave a year ago launching his campaign. Such rhetoric has exacerbated friction between Trump and Republican party leaders such as McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. For the past few years, the party has been trying to broaden its appeal with Latino voters and senior Republicans are concerned that Trump's comments could cost the party votes, not only in the presidential race but in congressional races as well. Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been mentioned as a possible running mate to Trump, called Trump's comments about the judge ""inexcusable."" ""This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made,"" Gingrich told Fox News. Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican-immigrant parents. ""He is a member of a club or society very strongly pro Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he's got bias. I want to build a wall,"" Trump said in an interview on Sunday on ""Face the Nation"". Asked if he believed a Muslim judge would be biased against him based on Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, Trump replied, ""It's possible. Yes."" McConnell said America is a nation full of immigrants — pointing out that his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, came to the United States when she was eight and didn't speak English. ""All of us came here from somewhere else,"" McConnell said. Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on ""ABC's This Week"" that he did not ""condone the comments"" that Trump made about Curiel. Legal scholars on the right and the left have criticized Trump for attacking the judge, saying it could harm judicial independence should he become president. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is of Mexican descent, was one of the few Republicans to defend Trump. Gonzales argued in a column in The Washington Post that Trump should be allowed to question a judge's fairness, saying that questioning a judge is crucial to ensuring public trust in the courts. But when asked about the racial element in an interview on Sunday on Fox News, Gonzales criticized Trump. ""I certainly would have taken a different approach,"" he said. ""Whenever you say something about a judge's nationality, I think it demeans the office and hurts the judiciary as a whole.""",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999974508553824

"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions. Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers. Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber. Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable. Enron Freight Markets During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades. On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile. By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks. EnronOnline On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999. Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives. Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001 ? Total Life to Date Transactions > 1 million ? Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $600 billion IN THE NEWS Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

"A disturbing video published by The Washington Post on June 29 shows a group of brainwashed students singing Twitter posts by President Donald Trump attempting to mock him. A group of about twelve children, entitled Washington Post Kids Chorus , are shown in a classroom banging on drums and waving American flags. The video is called The Washington Post s Kids Chorus Singing President Trump s Tweets . Following their mockery of President Donald Trump, the class sings the Post s new motto: Democracy Dies in Darkness .The Post does not state the name of the school or location where the mockery took place. The video, which was published on June 29 to the Post s verified YouTube account was also mentioned in the June 30 column, The Daily 202, titled The Daily 202 presents the world debut of the Washington Post Kids Chorus. Their first musical assignment had a political twist: the president s tweets.

Anything else is borderline brainwashing. Let the kids decide for themselves what their political beliefs are. No one else believes you so you have to trick children to push your narrative.

"The apprehension of illegal border crossers by Border Patrol agents jumped 31 percent in May from the previous month. The jump follows a decline in apprehensions after the election of President Donald Trump. The increase comes as Border Patrol agents report ""catch and release"" programs are quietly continuing. [While still down significantly from the peak in October 2016, Border Patrol agents apprehended 14, 535 illegal immigrants along the southwestern U. S. border with Mexico in May. That number is up from the low number of 11, 126 reported in April. Since 2014, the number of apprehensions has increased from April to May. The numbers of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) jumped a startling 50 percent from April to May (997 to 1, 493). During the same period, Family Unit Alien (FMUA) apprehensions jumped by 41 percent from 1, 118 in April to 1, 577 in May. Of the nine Border Patrol sectors along the U. S. southwest border, the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector continues to lead in the numbers of total apprehensions, accounting for nearly half of the 46, 183 apprehensions since October 1, 2016. The next closest sector is the Tucson Sector at 5, 925. The RGV sector also leads in UAC and FMUA apprehensions. So far this year, 4, 082 UACs have been apprehended in South Texas while 8, 718 FMUAs were apprehended. The El Paso Sector came in second place in both UAC and FMU apprehensions (621 and 1, 482 respectively). Border Patrol agents believe the resurgence can be attributed to the Trump Administration's quiet continuation of the Obama ""catch and release"" program, Breitbart Texas Brandon Darby and investigative journalist Ildefonso Ortiz reported. ""Obama's catch and release is definitely continuing and our government is releasing illegal aliens into U. S. communities,"" Border Patrol agent Brandon Judd told Breitbart Texas in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council. ""The steps taken for such releases have slightly changed and the numbers are not as high, but it is still occurring. Under Trump, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] is holding more illegal aliens than what they did under Obama, but make no mistake, ICE is still releasing a good number of illegal aliens into U. S. communities. Americans need to know this. "" Agents previously expressed feeling betrayed by the new president's administration after Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly appointed Kevin McAleenan as head of the U. S. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the U. S. Border Patrol. ""He nominated this guy .. the problem is that this guy was hired by Barack Obama and was made deputy of [CBP] and all of the things we fought against on the border happened under this guy's watch and he would have been the one responsible for implementing them. That's DACA, DAPA and Catch and Release. "" Darby said in a Pursuit of Happiness interview referring to some programs started under the Obama Administration. ""This is the guy who was picked by Barack Obama to enact Barack Obama's open border policies,"" Darby explained. ""This guy for some reason has been picked by Trump to be the boss of the border patrol agents who did so much and believed so much in Donald Trump.

"U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Following is a roundup of Wall Street's take on the likely outcome of the U.S. elections. Analysts still expect a Clinton win, but with a lower probability after the FBI revealed it is examining newly found emails related to Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.(reut.rs/2eVjseK) Prior to this revelation, analysts were largely focused on the likelihood – albeit a small one – of a Democratic sweep of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives this election, and the implications of such a scenario on financial markets. (reut.rs/2fcIZ2O) MORE COVERAGE: bit.ly/2dOgcoE Tina Fordham, Chief Global Political Analyst, Citigroup ""Our probability of a 75 pct probability of a Clinton victory remains unchanged due to our longstanding caution over the risks of Black Swans, but these developments (FBI's latest announcement on Clinton email probe) have added a significant obstacle to the Clinton campaign, and are likely to further dent voter confidence."" ""The FBI announcement could increase the risk that if Trump loses he does not accept the result, as he has threatened. If a Clinton victory transpires and she presides over a Republican-controlled or divided Congress, the risk of continuous investigations and future impeachment risk is non-negligible."" Shawn Golhar, Head of Public Policy Research, Barclays Capital ""While the FBI Director's letter may drive reluctant GOP voters to the polls and convince some remaining undecided voters to support Donald Trump, it is unclear if this will sway the election enough for Trump, given the Democratic electoral firewall, early voting indications, and Trump's lack of a voter turnout campaign."" ""The 2016 elections continue to have two tail end risks: Donald Trump wins, or the Democrats sweep the White House and both chambers of Congress. Friday's announcement will likely increase Trump's chances of winning and whittle down the already slim chances of a Democratic sweep."" Alec Phillips, U.S. Political Economist, Goldman Sachs ""The probability implied by online prediction markets that Sec. Clinton wins the White House has declined over the last several days, from between 80 pct and 90 pct in most markets over the last couple of weeks, to between 64 pct and 75 pct as of November 1... That said, Secretary Clinton is still seen by prediction markets to be twice as likely to win the election as Mr. Trump."" ""Polls have tightened in the U.S. presidential election... However, even after adjusting Sec. Clinton's lead in state polls for her diminished margin nationally, she still appears likely to win more than the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the White House."" ""As a starting point, note that the reliably Democratic states that Sec. Clinton currently leads by at least mid-single digits are worth 263 electoral votes. To reach 270, she must add to this North Carolina (15 EVs, Clinton leads by around 2pp), Colorado (9 EVs, Clinton leads by 1-2pp); and/or Nevada and the 2nd Congressional District of Maine (6 EVs plus 1 EV, Clinton leads by around 1pp in both)."" ""By contrast, Mr. Trump has a solid lead in states worth 186 EVs; to reach 270 he would need to add to this Arizona (11 EVs, Trump leads by around 1pp), Florida (29 EVs, Trump leads by around 1pp), Ohio (18 EVs, Trump leads by around 2pp), plus Colorado, Nevada, and North Carolina, or some other combination that scores electoral votes even deeper into Democratic territory."" ""This is still a significant polling deficit for Mr. Trump to overcome in a large number of states, particularly in contrast to Sec. Clinton, who simply needs to win one of the very competitive states she currently leads (Colorado, Nevada, or North Carolina) and maintain her sizable lead in the others to win."" Stephen Gallagher, Americas Head of Research, Societe Generale ""Our baseline outcome is for Secretary Clinton to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Donald Trump's chances are modest but still viable. The latest FBI interest in emails demonstrates that, 'It isn't over till it's over.'"" ""Traditionally, the losing candidate in a race concedes on the basis of incoming results, and that call is typically an early morning exercise. The challenge for 2016 is Trump's promise to maintain the suspense. Without a concession, markets and general public may presume the outcome on the basis of results, but difficult to confirm until states certify the results."" Thomas Block, Washington Policy Strategist, Fundstrat Global Advisors ""Fundamentals continue to point to a Clinton victory with 75 percent chances of a Clinton/Kaine win, but margins are likely to be closer in key swing states. However, Trump surprised and outperformed in primaries, and with recent events impossible to capture in polling, nothing is certain.""",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999966651177455

Trump (@AKADonaldTrump) October 28, 2017FOX News Special Counsel Robert Mueller is facing a fresh round of calls from conservative critics for his resignation from the Russia collusion probe, amid revelations that have called into question the FBI s own actions and potentially Mueller s independence.This week s bombshell that a controversial anti-Trump dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign has Republicans asking to what extent the FBI which received some of the findings and briefly agreed to pay the same researcher to gather intelligence on Trump and Russia used the politically connected material.Hill investigators also are looking into a Russian firm s uranium deal that was approved by the Obama administration in 2010 despite reports that the FBI then led by Mueller had evidence of bribery involving a subsidiary of that firm. Critics question whether Mueller s own ties to the bureau as well as fired FBI director James Comey now render him compromised as he investigates allegations of Russian meddling and collusion with Trump officials in the 2016 race. The federal code could not be clearer Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey, Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who first called for Mueller to step down over the summer, said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code. All of the revelations in recent weeks make the case stronger. Outgoing New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor and Trump ally, also suggested Friday that Mueller consider stepping aside. If the facts that you just laid out are true, then somebody with Bob Mueller s integrity will step aside and should if in fact those facts, as you laid them out, are true, Christie said on Fox & Friends, in response to various conflict-of-interest allegations.",1,fake_news,en,en,0.9999979027562953

"And the agency was ready for the critics. ""The only people with reason to oppose the rule,"" White House Senior Advisor Brian Deese told reporters on a press call Wednesday, ""are polluters who knowingly threaten our clean water."" So who are those willful polluters? Congressional Republicans, along with a select group of Democrats from farm and energy-heavy states, who are already pushing legislation aimed at crippling the rule in both Houses. They're characterizing it, as they do most EPA regulations, as a ""power grab"" and an overreach, and are vowing to destroy it the same way, presumably, they want to be allowed to destroy waterways. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) summed up the overwrought sentiment nicely in his reaction to the rule's release. ""The administration's decree to unilaterally expand federal authority is a raw and tyrannical power grab that will crush jobs,"" he said. ""These leaders know firsthand that the rule is being shoved down the throats of hardworking people with no input, and places landowners, small businesses, farmers, and manufacturers on the road to a regulatory and economic hell."" Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who is sponsoring a bill with Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and James Inhofe (R-Okla.) that would overturn the rule, called it ""reckless and unwarranted"" in a statement, and vowed to ""work tirelessly to stop this expansion of federal control."" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in announcing the rule this morning, in fact pointed out that the agency has received over one million public comments on the rule since it was proposed last year. And it was based, she emphasized, on the best available peer-reviewed science. McCarthy also took care to stress that the rule has been changed from the proposed version to clarify that it does not apply to ditches or groundwater, and that agriculture will continue to be exempted. The rule ""does not interfere with private property rights or address land use,"" she elaborated. ""It does not regulate any ditches unless they function as tributaries. It does not apply to groundwater or shallow subsurface water, copper tile drains or change policy on irrigation or water transfer."" ""Farmers, ranchers, and foresters are all original conservationists, and we recognize that,"" McCarthy said. Farmers are nonetheless some of the strongest opponents of the rule, along with other business interests New York Times identifies as ""property developers, fertilizer and pesticide makers, oil and gas producers and a national association of golf course owners"" — again, polluters that, under the status quo, are getting away with it. Those in favor of the rule, on the other hand? Aside from the usual groups interested in protecting the environment, which are all pretty thrilled, it's backed, per one poll, by 80 percent of voters and, per McCarthy, 80 percent of small business owners. Craft breweries are also big fans: ""Beer is about 90 percent water, making local water supply quality and its characteristics, such as pH and mineral content, critical to brewing,"" a coalition of beer companies wrote to the EPA in 2014. President Obama, too, stood up for the rule Wednesday, asserting in a statement that it ""will provide the clarity and certainty businesses and industry need about which waters are protected by the Clean Water Act, and it will ensure polluters who knowingly threaten our waters can be held accountable.""",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999973450517793

"It turns out that there are more than just one audio recording out there where you can hear Donald Trump saying terribly misogynistic things. Around the same period a hot mic caught Donald Trump bragging about using his fame to sexually assault women in 2005, he also did an interview with Howard Stern where he said some very creepy and misogynistic things about his wife and daughter. This includes a bit of audio where Trump told Stern that it was okay for the shock DJ to call his daughter a piece of ass. My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka, says Trump during the interview. By the way, your daughter, says Stern. She s beautiful, responds Trump. Can I say this? A piece of ass, Stern responds. Yeah, says Trump.During the show, Trump also called his wife Melania Trump a monster and a blimp. According to Trump he meant this to be a positive statement. That s because he was referring to Melania s breasts. Like a blimp in the right places. In her case, the right places. I mean she really has become a monster in all the right places. I mean monster in the most positive way. She has gotten very, very large in all the right places. Donald Trump s mouth is costing him big. It seems as if every hour another elected Republican has denounced Trump after Friday s release of the now infamous audio that has Trump s campaign burning in flames. Several have called for him to drop out of the race altogether. Even Mike Pence, his running mate had some sharp words for his electoral wingman. Funding halts suggest the RNC is prepared to stop supporting the Republican presidential nominee altogether. From now until the election or Trump actually does end up dropping out more skeletons from Trump s past are going to come out and consume his campaign. Remember just last week when it was revealed that Trump probably has not paid any income taxes in nearly two decades? The scandals just do not end with this loser. His campaign is toast. The fact that he has managed to stay as strong as he has in the race is a sad commentary on the state of the U.S. politics. Trump, do yourself a favor and drop out already. It s only going to get worse from you from here on out.Featured image from Win McNamee/Getty Images",1,fake_news,en,en,0.9999968718509487

"President Donald Trump's disavowal this week of a bipartisan agreement to stabilize Obamacare has further eroded the already minimal trust congressional Democrats had in him, complicating prospects for gaining their cooperation on a range of issues. Trump's fellow Republicans who control Congress will need at least some Democratic support to pass critical legislation in the coming months to avert a government shutdown and prevent an unprecedented U.S. debt default. ""I've been here with every president since Jerry Ford,"" said Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974 and is its longest-serving member. ""I've always been willing to negotiate with anybody because they always keep their word. If you have a president who doesn't keep his word, it makes it more difficult,"" Leahy said when asked about Trump's interactions with Congress. Trump initially backed the bipartisan deal announced on Tuesday by Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for shoring up insurance marketplaces established under Obamacare for two years by reviving federal subsidies to private insurers that Trump has scrapped. A day later, Trump disowned it. Going forward, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said that while more collaboration with Trump is possible, ""I think we have to know that we can't count on him."" Trump enraged Republicans in September with his collaboration with top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and top House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Trump cut a short-term spending deal with them, blindsiding Republican leaders, and then discussed with them the outlines of a plan to revive protections for young adult immigrants dubbed ""Dreamers"" brought into the United States illegally as children. On both healthcare and Dreamers, Trump has shown that while he relishes deal-making, he is quick to row back in the face of a conservative backlash. The president also has sent signals over the past few weeks that he is wavering on working with Democrats to help the Dreamers, making demands that could be a deal-breaker. Republicans have worked seven years to get rid of Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, and many of them vehemently opposed the Alexander-Murray deal. It remains unclear whether it will ever come to a vote in the Senate or House. Because spending legislation requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate and there are 52 Republican senators, it cannot pass without at least eight Democrats backing it. Because hard-line House conservatives often oppose spending bills, Democratic support is expected to be needed there as well. A Dec. 8 deadline is looming for passing the spending measure needed to prevent a shutdown. Democrats could demand a steep price for their support, potentially an Obamacare fix and action to help the Dreamers. Under a budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday night, Republicans need only a simple majority to pass Trump's proposed major tax cuts, though he has urged Democrats to support the overhaul. Schumer, who Trump earlier in the year called the Democrats' ""head clown"" before their thaw last month, this week vented his frustration about the president, saying he ""keeps zigging and zagging so it's impossible to govern."" ""This president cannot govern if, whenever the hard right frightens him and says 'jump,' he says 'how high?'"" Schumer told reporters on Wednesday. Schumer and Pelosi dined at the White House with Trump last month, and left feeling as if they had a deal on a proposal to help continue protections for the Dreamers that the president has moved to end effective in March. Within a day, Trump began distancing himself from that deal, with the White House later floating a series of hard-line immigration ""principles,"" including money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border fiercely opposed by Democrats, that have thrown the entire effort into doubt. Pelosi and Schumer argue their deal with Trump is still salvageable, as the president himself has not called it off. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill acknowledged that the principles ""don't help"" the effort. But Hammill said that would not stop Pelosi, a former House speaker first elected to the chamber in 1987, from engaging Trump in the future. ""It was always a case-by-case thing. It was never 'the switch was on'"" full-time, Hammill said. There will be plenty of cases to come in the weeks ahead, giving Trump an opportunity to improve his relations with Democrats if that is what he wants, Hammill said. As Congress and the White House approach the December deadline for settling fiscal affairs, Hammill said Trump can use that opportunity to stabilize Obamacare and shield Dreamers from deportation. ""If he's unable to do that, we're unable to work with him on his priorities,"" including taxes, Hammill said.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999956191218571

"A bunch of the NRA s responsible gun owners in Florida rang in the new year with gunfire something that had a very negative impact on at least one little girl s ability to enjoy herself. As she was leaving an Orlando church just after midnight, a massive amount of gunfire rang out. Was ISIS attacking? Nope. Was there yet another mass shooting happening? Negative. Was the American Taliban celebrating New Year s Day by wildly firing their weapons? Bingo.As the girl was exiting the service at a church on the 800 block of South Kirkman Road, the was struck in the right arm by a bullet, according to police. Law enforcement says that the girl was not targeted the bullet came from one of many individuals who were wildly firing their self-defense weapons into the air in celebration of the holiday. There are many ways to enjoy the New Year, but firing random shots in the air should not be among them, Orange County Sheriff Demings in a statement. Unfortunately, police do not think a suspect can be found because the round that struck the little girl seemed to be from the voluminous amounts of gunfire happening at the time of this senseless shooting.Firing a gun in public or on a residential property is a crime, and can range from a first-degree misdemeanor to a third-degree felony. Unfortunately, the nation s ammosexuals do not care much about laws regarding guns, with many demanding that gun sellers ignore Obama s planned executive action to keep these dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who should not have them a group that probably includes every single person who felt the appropriate way to ring in the new year is by randomly firing their guns and almost killing a child.The little girl was treated on the scene by the Orlando Fire Department, and is expected to recover from her injuries fortunately.Watch a report on this senseless shooting below:",1,fake_news,en,en,0.9999997824494725

"Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said on Tuesday he is ready to sign a transgender rights bill if it passes in its current form in the state House of Representatives amid an acrimonious debate across the United States about the issue. Baker, a socially liberal Republican, had come under fire this year for refusing to say whether he would approve the bill, which would ban discrimination against transgender people in public restrooms and other public buildings. It passed the state Senate last month. ""No one should be discriminated against in Massachusetts because of their gender identity,"" Baker said in a statement. ""I would sign the House version in its current form should it reach my desk."" The Massachusetts House is due to vote on the measure on Wednesday. It is expected to pass by a wide margin in the Democratic-controlled chamber. The House version of the bill differs from the version passed by the Senate in that it directs the state attorney general to issue guidelines to law enforcement on how to handle people who claim transgender rights ""for an improper purpose."" That language is a nod to one of the main concerns of opponents of people using bathrooms or locker rooms that do not correspond with their birth gender - that sexual predators will claim transgender status to access potential victims. The measure would make liberal-leaning Massachusetts the 18th U.S. state to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. The issue of transgender rights has become the latest front in America's culture wars. Some supporters of the Massachusetts measure described it as a rebuke to a law put in place in March in North Carolina prohibiting people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to the sex on their birth certificates.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999965308991964
"Shocking video out of Chicago shows a mob of young black men viciously beating an older white man because he voted for Donald Trump, dragging him through the streets as he hangs out of the back of his car. The clip shows the thugs repeatedly screaming, ""you voted Donald Trump"" as they assault the victim from every angle while others steal his belongings. ""You voted Trump,"" the mob screams, ""You gonna pay for that sh*t."" Another woman shouts ""beat his ass,"" while another man is heard laughing before remarking, ""Don't vote Trump."" A second video of the incident which is dubbed with the ""F**k Donald Trump"" song, a phrase now being chanted by ""protesters"" across the country, shows one of the attackers driving away in the man's vehicle while his hand is still stuck in the window as the car drags him down the street. ""The scene is frankly reminiscent of a lynching,"" remarks Chris Menahan . It is not even clear if the victim was a Trump supporter. Presumably, the mob used that as an excuse to beat and rob him. YouTube quickly deleted the video, but it has been mirrored on numerous different websites. If the roles had been reversed, and Trump supporters had been caught on tape viciously beating a black Hillary voter, this would be a national news story right now. This is simply unacceptable  As it is, you won't see this on CNN any time soon. Perhaps blacks should also be deported to Africa… they never seem to be satisfied, no one ever seems to make them happy. They even rioted and protested during Obama, with one of their own as president. Black Lives Matter was formed during Obama. Besides maybe us whites are bad with them and misbehave with them, sometimes willingly and purposefully while other times by mistake. So it would be best if we separate so that we don't have these ancient conflicts anymore. This man who was beaten so badly never did anything wrong to these people, neither willingly nor unwillingly but these conflicts still happen because we are not compatible with each other. After all first Republican president Abraham Lincoln believed in separation , he freed them from slavery but he also said: I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races – that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything. Now we do disagree with Lincoln's idea of superior-inferior relationship. It would however be best to separate though. It just doesn't work. Despite having almost 2 centuries now since the Emancipation Proclamation, conflicts still run rampant and no real friendship has ever been established. They should be resettled perhaps to Liberia, a plan supported by Abraham Lincoln and be helped financially with billions or even trillions of dollars until they can start their own economy and industry. They do deserve that. Anyone intermarried with them should be free to either stay in the US and divorce or simply go along with their families. Source",1,fake_news,en,en,0.9999940949952814

"German voters are punishing the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) for walking out of three-way coalition talks last month as a poll showed on Thursday support for the party falling and the popularity of its leader Christian Lindner tumbling. The FDP in mid-November quit exploratory talks to form a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the environmentalist Greens. Lindner said back then it was better not to govern than to govern the wrong way. Some observers speculated that the FDP had planned the move well in advance to boost its standing among voters from the center-right political spectrum and to show the party puts policy principles before power. But the monthly DeutschlandTrend survey, conducted by Infratest Dimap pollster for ARD public broadcaster, showed that support for the FDP fell 3 percentage points to 9 percent, making it the smallest party in parliament. Merkel s conservatives gained 2 percentage points to 32 percent, the Social Democrats (SPD) were unchanged at 21 percent. The far-right Alternative for Germany stood at 13 percent, followed by the Greens with 11 percent and the Left party with 10 percent. The popularity of FDP leader Lindner plunged 17 percentage points to only 28 percent. Merkel s popularity fell 3 percentage points to 54 percent, her lowest level in the survey since October 2016. The list of Germany s most popular politicians was topped by SPD Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel who shot up 8 percentage points to 65 percent.

"Harrison Ford, the actor known for his portrayal of a cocky smuggler and spacecraft pilot in the ""Star Wars"" movies, mistakenly flew a private plane over a commercial airliner carrying more than 100 people at a California airport on Monday, according to a news report. Mr. Ford, 74, an avid pilot and collector of vintage planes, had been instructed to land on a runway at John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, Calif. He correctly read back the instructions but landed instead on a taxiway parallel to the runway. In doing so, he flew his plane, a Aviat Husky, over a 737 that was stopped just ahead of the runway. NBC News, which reported on the episode, said Mr. Ford's plane flew over an American Airlines jet with 110 passengers and a crew. It was unclear how far above the airliner he was. NBC reported that Mr. Ford could be heard on control recordings asking, ""Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?"" For Mr. Ford, who played Han Solo, the swashbuckling pilot of the Millennium Falcon in the ""Star Wars"" movies, the errant landing was the second notable episode involving an aircraft he was piloting in nearly two years and the fourth since 1999. On Tuesday, Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration's Pacific division, confirmed most details of the episode and said that the agency was investigating it. No one was injured. Mr. Gregor did not confirm that Mr. Ford was piloting the private plane because the agency does not identify people involved in aircraft episodes or accidents. Mr. Gregor, speaking in general, said in an email that pilots who violated agency regulations could face penalties ranging from a warning letter to having their licenses suspended or revoked. Landing on a taxiway is a violation of federal safety rules. United Talent Agency, which represents Mr. Ford, referred inquiries to his publicist, Ina Treciokas, who declined to comment Tuesday night. Mr. Ford is certified as a private pilot and is rated by the F. A. A. to fly several types of aircraft, including a helicopter, according to agency records. He has been inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation and has an honor named after him, the Harrison Ford Aviation Legacy Award. Other episodes involving Mr. Ford and aircraft: • In March 2015, Mr. Ford was injured when a World War training plane he was piloting crashed onto a golf course in Venice, Calif. shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Airport. The plane had engine trouble on takeoff, and Mr. Ford was forced to make an emergency landing. He was ""banged up"" but walked away from the scene, his publicist said at the time. • In June 2000, while landing in Lincoln, Neb. a gust blew Mr. Ford's plane from the runway. The aircraft, a Beechcraft Bonanza, sustained minor damage, and neither Mr. Ford nor his passenger were injured, AirSafe. com, a website about plane crashes, reported. • In October 1999 in Santa Clarita, Calif. Mr. Ford was on a training flight in a Bell 206 helicopter when he and the instructor made an emergency landing in a dry riverbed, according to AirSafe. com. Neither Mr. Ford nor the instructor were hurt, but the helicopter was substantially damaged.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999973547893883

"It has nothing to do with Russia. That s the story the Trump campaign is sticking to. Paul Manafort, Trump s dictator-protecting campaign manager, has doubled down: we are not releasing his tax returns. The reason? His taxes are under audit, so they can t (even though the head of the IRS completely debunked that claim on live national television).For months Democrats and even Republicans have been hounding the billionaire mogul to release his tax returns, a standard that every presidential hopeful has met over the last several decades. But Trump seems to be the only one who will not do it. Even Romney, after enough prodding, did it.There s several theories as to why he won t release them. The first is that they will show he s not actually a billionaire. Another is that it will show he has overvalued his properties (which has already been shown he has) and his businesses. The third option is that it will show he paid virtually nothing in taxes, certainly not his fair share.And the fourth (and now most plausible theory): he has ties to Russian interests/oligarchs. That s the theory of conservative columnist George Will. Given that the FBI has a strong case linking Russia to the DNC email hack, and Trump s campaign manager has close ties to Russia, and that Trump has business dealings with the authoritarian country, that theory seems to stick in people s mind. And it should.Trump has been a serial liar throughout this campaign. He s had the audacity to say Hillary Clinton has taken money from countries that kill gays and women. But the evidence is starting to show it is Trump who has taken not only taken money, but has offered his soul to a country that also kills gays, women, and anyone who dares to dissent (remember the Winter Olympics controversy)?For a man who claims he wants American sovereignty and autonomy, he certainly has no problem letting his buddies at the Kremlin determine our political discourse.Of course Will s speculation is just that speculation. But it does raise the question that Trump s refusal to release his tax returns and his love and shady dealings with Russia and Putin may be more than what meets the eye.Like Trump University, this story won t be going away anytime soon. And the Democrats certainly won t be letting it go.This election, it s Trump/Putin 2016.",1,fake_news,en,en,0.999995374445007

Rivals help improve Dell's outlook Dell Computer on Thursday raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter, saying it continues to gain market share from computer rivals. The company said it now expects revenue for the quarter that ends Aug. 2 will reach $8.3 billion, up about 9 percent from last year's second quarter, with earnings of 19 cents per share. On May 16, the company predicted revenue would hit $8.2 billion and projected earnings at 18 cents per share.DELL COMPUTER CORP 24.98 4.39% Lukewarm response to Juniper moves Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass. Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings Thursday.

"The 400,000 civilians besieged in the Syrian enclave of Eastern Ghouta face complete catastrophe because aid deliveries are blocked and hundreds of people need urgent medical evacuation, U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said on Thursday. Seven people have died because they were not evacuated and 29 more were at imminent risk including 18 children, he told reporters in Geneva after a regular meeting of the U.N. humanitarian taskforce on Syria. I feel as if we are now returning to some of the bleakest days of this conflict again, Egeland said. Nowhere is it as bad as in Eastern Ghouta, he said of the area, which is surrounded by the army. The area east of Damascus had been completely sealed off since September, leaving U.N. aid convoys and evacuations as a potential lifeline facing a bureaucratic wall of inaction . We cannot continue like that. If we only get a fraction of what is needed it will be a complete catastrophe, he said. What about a ceasefire now in this area and a green light to all medical evacuations? As well as people wounded in the fighting, there were a growing number of acutely malnourished children, which meant they were very close to dying, he said. Why men in their 50s and 60s like me stop women and children from getting the medical service that would save their lives is beyond my imagination. It can change tomorrow. Russian, Syrian and U.N. officials had met in Damascus to try to break the deadlock, both for Eastern Ghouta and for about 55,000 civilians stranded on the Jordanian border in a desolate area known as the Berm. The first meeting still hasn t produced at all the concrete results that were needed but it is our strong feeling that the Russian Federation wants us to get the access and wants to help us so we are hopeful that this trilateral mechanism will yield results. The Berm had not received an aid distribution since June, but the United States, Russia and others had worked out a detailed plan to supply aid from Damascus. Despite diplomatic efforts to set up de-escalation zones there was still fighting in many areas, including Aleppo, Idlib, Raqqa, Deir al-Zor and Hama, and civilians were being caught in the crossfire. He said the war had lasted longer than the Second World War, and supplies were depleted, so that the coming winter could be the toughest of the war even if it is the last. This is a man-made disaster, it can end, Egeland said.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999973973127186

"The speaker-elect walked down the center aisle Thursday morning, accepting hugs, kisses, handshakes and applause. Then he did something unexpected: He turned left. Paul Ryan, the young Wisconsin Republican who in minutes would accept the speaker's gavel, walked through the Democratic side of the well. He accepted a bear hug from Rep. Gene Green (Tex.) and handshakes from Rep. John Conyers (Mich.) and a half-dozen other African American Democrats. He reached in to greet Rep. Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) in her wheelchair; shook hands with Rep. Sander Levin (Mich.), a frequent critic; and hugged Rep. John Lewis (Ga.), the civil rights icon. ""If you ever pray, pray for each other: Republicans for Democrats and Democrats for Republicans,"" Ryan told the House. To laughter, he added: ""And I don't mean pray for a conversion, all right? Pray for a deeper understanding, because when you're up here, you see it so clearly: Wherever you come from, whatever you believe, we are all in the same boat."" There was rapt silence when, a moment later, Ryan said: ""Let's be frank. The House is broken. . . . And I am not interested in laying blame. We are not settling scores. We are wiping the slate clean."" Just about everybody — even, after some hesitation, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) — rose and applauded. I felt goose bumps watching from the gallery, for a most unfamiliar sense of hope had admitted itself to the bitterly divided chamber. In this dark hour for the House, there was a tantalizing glimpse that the institution, which has strayed so far from what the Founders created, could heal itself. Only an ingénue would believe all will be different now. But only the most hardened cynic would dismiss the possibility of what Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), in her speech nominating Ryan, called a ""fresh start."" For a day, the ideological freak show was shut down. Only nine Republicans voted against Ryan, a far more unified showing than in January, when 25 opposed John Boehner. For the moment, the Republican speaker was overtly courting Democrats. And for once, Democrats and Republicans were rising in unison to applaud. ""How reassuring it would be,"" Ryan told his colleagues, ""if we actually fixed the tax code, put patients in charge of their health care, grew our economy, strengthened our military, lifted people out of poverty and paid down our debt."" Pelosi shrugged and looked around. Finding nothing objectionable in what Ryan had said, she rose and joined in the applause. It may not be long before Ryan winds up in the same position Boehner was for five years: forced to bring up pointless abortion bills and Obamacare repeals and otherwise placating hard-liners. But he may be the only one who has a shot at repairing the chamber, because of his youth (he's 45), his renown (Mitt Romney, on whose ticket Ryan ran in 2012, watched the proceedings as Ryan's guest in the speaker's box) and his popularity. Pelosi, handing the gavel to Ryan, offered ""the hand of friendship"" from Democrats, and said: ""This is the speaker's house."" She corrected herself: ""This is the people's house."" But her misstatement was apt: For now, at least, this is Paul Ryan's house. Ryan benefits from a big parting gift from Boehner, who in his final days infuriated conservatives one last time by negotiating a bipartisan deal that will postpone budget and debt-limit fights until 2017. The outgoing speaker waved a box of tissues to his chuckling colleagues before his farewell speech, and he dabbed his eyes as he pleaded for reason. ""Yes, freedom makes all things possible,"" he said, ""but patience is what makes all things real."" Boehner was not a great speaker — he was often paralyzed by the right — but he is a good man. His parting boasts about achievements were dubious, but the emotion was real. ""I describe my life as a chase for the American Dream,"" he said, his voice breaking. The departing speaker was still wiping his eyes when, standing in the back of the chamber, he heard Pelosi celebrate him as ""the personification of the American Dream,"" and Ryan accurately call him ""a man of character."" ""Now I know how he felt,"" Ryan said, confiding that the weight of the office makes him feel that ""the moon, the stars and all the planets had fallen on me."" He suggested his colleagues should feel the weight of their offices, too. ""At bottom,"" the speaker said, ""we vindicate a way of life. We show by our work that free people can govern themselves."" That proposition is now seriously in question. Let's all — Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives — pray for Ryan's success in defending it.

"A woman at the center of a New York Times piece detailing Republican Donald Trump's history with women took issue with the story on Monday, saying she never had a negative experience with the billionaire and does not believe he ever mistreated women. Rowanne Brewer Lane, a former model who dated Trump for several months starting in the late 1990s, said her words were mischaracterized in the Times article, which used dozens of interviews to show what it said was a pattern of unsettling personal behavior by the presidential candidate with women. The Times story said Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, asked Lane to change into a bikini shortly after meeting her at a pool party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. According to the article, he then introduced her to the crowd outside, saying, ""That is a stunning Trump girl, isn't it?"" On Monday, Lane told the same story in a series of television interviews but said she had been flattered by his comment. ""They spun it to where it appeared negative,"" Lane said on Fox News. ""I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump."" Lane said that during the time she and Trump were dating, he ""never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way."" She also said she supports Trump's presidential run. The New York Times responded to Lane's accusations by saying she was quoted ""fairly, accurately and at length."" ""The story provides context for the reader including that the swimsuit scene was the 'start of a whirlwind romance' between Ms. Brewer Lane and Mr. Trump,"" Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in a statement. Trump has deflected criticism about his attitude toward women throughout his campaign. On Monday, he called the New York Times ""so dishonest."" ""Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!"" Trump posted on Twitter. Times reporters Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey defended their story in several television interviews on Monday, saying it showed how Trump behaved privately with women and revealed common themes including unwelcome advances, aggression and commentary on their appearance.

"I simply put together the stories that YOUR profession reported, on the public record. Do you deny there were two FISA applications? Do you deny the first was turned down? Do you deny the second was approved? It s called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. It is about surveillance. The fact that we cannot discern all the details because of the secrecy, except for what the media have revealed and selective leaks by the government, should cause you to want to know more, not to trash those who point it out.And yes, we can make several logical implications based on events and experience. A FISA application is a big deal. One, or two in this case, that involve campaign surrogates, or a server or computer related to a candidate or campaign, etc., is a big deal. President Obama s statement is not a definitive statement of anything, other than he, personally, did not order a wiretap, which I never claimed. But that does not mean he was unaware of surveillance activity by several of his departments, even through routine reports to the president, such as the Daily Intel Briefing or information conveyed to him or his staff via the Justice Department re the FBI counter-intelligence activities. As for Clapper, despite his past dissembling before Congress, he may not have been aware of what was taking place since the FBI counter-intel operation reportedly sought the warrant. The Daily Intel Briefing might provide useful information in that regard as well.Of course, the release of the FISA applications would also shed a lot of light on events, assuming YOU believe reports that they were filed.Furthermore, Clapper has said, as recently as yesterday, that no connections between the Russians and the Trump campaign have been found. I am extremely critical of Russia, Putin, and the efforts to influence our election, although I do not believe they succeeded. That said, how would Clapper know of no connections if he, as former Director of National Intelligence, didn t look? On what is that based?Your lack of curiosity and dishonesty about such matters and in dealing with me demean you and your profession. You are free to circulate this communication to whomever you wish, as I am making it public.",1,fake_news,en,en,0.9999976450011695

"Immediately following the election, a few leftist designers announced they wouldn t work with Melania Trump. Their decision to not offer their fashion creations to Melania hasn t seemed to have had much of an effect on her. Melania has brought elegance, class and most of all, style back to the White House that we haven t seen since the Jackie Kennedy era.Apparently, Vanity Fair missed the excitement and enthusiasm so many women (and men) seem to have for seeing photos of the always meticulously dressed First Lady Melania Trump, because somehow, her name was kept off their Best Dressed Women of 2017 list, but several names that appeared on their list have many Americans scratching their heads in disbelief.Melania made her first major fashion statement on the day her husband was inaugurated as our 45th President, where she was seen wearing a stunning two-piece, robin s egg blue, Ralph Lauren suit.Later in the evening, Melania stunned again in a sleek white, off-the-shoulder column dress with a modest slit revealing her toned legs, as she and President Trump danced to Frank Sinatra s My Way. There have been countless photos of Melania carrying herself with grace, class, and elegance as truly one of the most well-dressed First Lady s in history.Melania stunned the world in her luxurious black pants suit on her first overseas trip to Saudi Arabia with President Trump:Again, Melania pulled off another amazing pants suit on her trip to Saudi Arabia, that even made some of us forget about the damage Hillary Clinton had done to the image of pants suits on women.But Vanity Fair s list apparently is less a list of well dressed individuals and couples, and more a list of individuals who lean left. Here are a few of the people who did make Vanity Fair s list:Here are a few of the people who did make Vanity Fair s Best Dressed Women list:Beyonce s sister, (Yes, the same sister who was caught on camera beating and kicking Jay Z in an elevator.) Solange Knowles made the list. Because why?We don t need to go into the whole love-fest between Solange s much more famous sister Beyonce and the Obama s, do we?And the entertainer Rhianna, who usually looks like she just walked out a freak show, and calls women up to the stage while she s performing to grind on them in front of a packed house, was also named as one of Vanity Fair s Best Dressed . Did we mention that she was a huge Obama supporter? When she visited the White House, she told her fans that the best part of the visit was that Obama was black . She probably just forgot that he is also white. Anyhow, it s probably pretty clear why Vanity Fair chose her.Vanity Fair even had a Best Dressed Couples category, and to the surprise of no one, the Obama s and the Macron s made the list that should have been renamed the High Profile People On The Left Who Wear Clothes . Of course, Michelle and Barack made the list. Even funnier, is the fact that Vanity Fair chose this photo to highlight Michelle s great taste in clothing.And then there s the leftist first couple of France, the Macron s. We must concede, that Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron are the only leftists on this list that we believe actually have any business being on a Best Dressed list. Like Melania Trump, France s first lady never disappoints when it comes to fashion. Vanity Fair did however mention Melania and her fashion sense in arecent article, but it was anything but flattering, as they attempted to accuse her of copying (of all people) Michelle Obama, as a way to make her more appealing to Americans. LOL!From the Vanity Fair article:Melania Trump appears to be taking a page out of the Michelle Obama book of fashion. The usually designer-clad Trump flew from Camp David to D.C. over the weekend wearing a surprisingly affordable $75 pink gingham shirt from J.Crew along with a pair of matching J Brand pink pants and Manolo Blahnik flats. According to Yahoo Style Canada, the button-up top is a discontinued piece from the brand s 2012 collection. Perhaps she s been waiting to save the economical top for just the right moment in her First Lady reign.The mall brand is a major departure from the First Lady s typical designer wardrobe, which is occasionally criticized for being over the top and out of touch. Trump s predecessor Michelle Obama was often lauded for wearing J.Crew during her time in the White House, coming across as a more relatable and accessible First Lady than many in the past. It seems entirely possible that Trump is ripping out a page from the Obama handbook in order to drum up some much-needed goodwill from the public.",1,fake_news,en,en,0.99999785382477
"Turkish warplanes struck Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq on Tuesday, killing three militants, the military said, as part of a widening campaign against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). In a statement, the military said the air strikes targeted the Zap region, the Turkish name for a river which flows across the Turkish-Iraqi border and is known as Zab in Iraq. The air strike was the second on Tuesday and the third in the past two days since Turkish soldiers started a military drill along the Iraqi border. The army was training tank guns and rocket launchers across the southern border on Tuesday, less than a week before a Kurdish independence referendum in northern Iraq. The show of force ahead of the vote reflects the scale of concern in Turkey, which has the largest Kurdish population in the region, that the plebiscite could embolden the outlawed Kurdish PKK which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey s southeast since 1984. The Turkish air force has frequently struck against PKK units in the mountains of northern Iraq. The group is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and European Union.",0,fake_news,en,en,0.9999975960205603
"This is a nice piece of equipment you can use at home to mainly exercise the chest, front shoulder, and back of the arms. It's durable, sturdy, portable, has great range of grips, and it's effective. I've had them for months now and use them quite frequently and they still are in good shape. These are very sturdy construction and easy to assemble. I strongly recommend Big Mike's push-up bars.",1,product_reviews,en,en,0.9999969033882046
"Research could 'potentially serve as a curative approach for patients with HIV', scientist says  Scientists have managed to remove DNA of the HIV virus from living tissue for the first time in a breakthrough that could lead to an outright cure. At the moment, treating the disease involves the use of drugs that suppress levels of the virus so the body's immune system can cope. Now researchers in the US have revealed they used gene-editing technology to remove DNA of the commonest HIV-1 strain from several organs of infected mice and rats. In April, the same team reported that they had successfully eliminated the virus from human cells in the laboratory, but a paper in the journal Nature Gene Editing revealed they had managed to do the same thing in live animals for the first time. The researchers' team leader, Professor Kamel Khalili, of Temple University, said: ""In a proof-of-concept study, we show[ed] that our gene-editing technology can be effectively delivered to many organs of two small animal models and excise large fragments of viral DNA from the host cell genome."" The current antiretroviral drugs for HIV are not able to eliminate HIV-1 from the infected cells. And if treatment is interrupted, the virus can start replicating quickly, putting patients of risk of getting full-blow AIDS.  This is because it is able to persist in immune system T-cells and other places where it is not actually active and is unaffected by the current treatments.  The researchers used a specially adapted virus to deliver the gene-editing system into the cells. ""The ability of the rAAV delivery system to enter many organs containing the HIV-1 genome and edit the viral DNA is an important indication that this strategy can also overcome viral reactivation from latently infected cells and potentially serve as a curative approach for patients with HIV,"" Professor Khalili said. In a statement, Temple University said the implications of the new study were ""far-reaching"". ""The gene-editing platform by itself may be able to eradicate HIV-1 DNA from patients, but it is also highly flexible and potentially could be used in combination with existing antiretroviral drugs to further suppress viral RNA. It also could be adapted to target mutated strains of HIV-1,"" it added. Professor Khalili said a clinical trial could happen within the next few years, but he first planned to carry out a similar study involving a larger group of animals.
